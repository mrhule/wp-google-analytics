## Description ##

Simple Wordpress Plugin built using https://wppb.me/ boilerplate that allows a user to input a Google Analytics tracking code that will be inserted into the user's Wordpress site. 

A few notes about this plugin:

*   It is overly "complex" for what it does
*   The regex only valids if the GA code is correct and stores "Invalid" if wrong
*   This plug in is more likely to crash your site than be of any help
